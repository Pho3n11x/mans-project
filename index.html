    <h3>What is work ethic?</h3>
    
<p>Work ethic is a set of standards of behavior and beliefs regarding what is and isn’t acceptable to do at work.
  
  Work ethic can be strong (good) or poor (bad), it depends on personal views of employees, their motivation, and overall company culture.
  
  A strong work ethic is an attitude an employee applies to their work that indicates a high level of passion for any work they do.
  
  A bad work ethic is an attitude that an employee demonstrates that shows a lack of ambition and professionalism in the workplace.
  
  People with a strong work ethic often seem as though they have a competitive spirit, although their competitiveness is often within themselves to achieve their goals within their occupation.
  
  Those individuals with a strong work ethic often present themselves as ‘ideal employees’ because their drive for success leads them to work to achieve one goal after another.
  
  Work ethic can be nurtured, although it’s often a part of an individual’s character and overall outlook on life.</p>    
    

<h4>Why is work ethic important?</h4>

<p>Work ethic may seem like a subjective topic, but for human resources departments, knowing what it is and how it works is important.
  
  A strong work ethic within the company serves as a behavioral model for the right way of working. It supports and fosters a productive working culture.
  
  Employees with a strong work ethic are highly driven and often far exceed their peers in terms of achieving company goals.
  
  They lead by example and motivate others to work hard. Of course, it must be part of the work culture, and everybody should support it.
  
  Otherwise, one employee with a strong work ethic in a collective of people with poor work ethic will eventually exhibit the same attitude or will leave the company.
  
  Bad work ethic, put another way, can lead to demotivation, loss of effectiveness, sometimes even to high turnover rate and other damaging consequences.
  
  So, it is vital for the HR department to track and adjust work ethic within the company, department, or even of the particular employee.
  
  We won’t say that employees with a strong work ethic are better choices for promotion within the company, but they are the first candidates for this, because of their drive and commitment to their job.</p>
